# Hi there 👋
I'm Sam — a minimal coder who's still learning and figuring things out. My desired IDE is VS Code.

## What I do

* I build simple static websites.
* I write small script and programs here and there.
* Create Extensions for Browsers.

## What I'm learning
I'm currently learning to become a front-end web developer. At the same time I take a strong interest in the cybersecurity domain, especially the penetration testing field.

Right now, I have a little knowledge of:

* Ports and basic cybersecurity concepts
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Python (beginner level)
